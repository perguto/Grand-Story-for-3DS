# Ace Attorney Trilogy SiIvagunner Mod for 3DS

The highest quality BGM for Ace Attorney Trilogy (3DS). Works on jailbroken 3DSes as well as with the Citra emulator.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release.
2. Unzip the folder. You'll get a folder named "0004000000138F00" (This is the Game ID of the American version)
3. 
    * a. For Citra: 
    
    Open Citra, right-click on your Ace Attorney Trilogy ROM and choose "Open Mods Location" then put the `romfs` folder from inside the extracted folder into that location. All in all, the path to the sound files should read `[YOUR CITRA FOLDER]\user\load\mods\0004000000138F00\romfs\sound\stream\BGM200.dspadpcm.bcstm` etc. (the number will be different if you don't have the US version of the game).

    * b. For jailbroken 3DS: 
    
    Put the `0004000000138F00` folder into the `\luma\titles\` directory of your 3DS SD card. If you don't have the US version of the game, change the name of thee `0004000000138F00` folder accordingly:
- Europe:	`0004000000133300`
- Taiwan:	`0004000000132900`
- Japan:	`0004000000108800`
(So the path to the audios will be `\luma\titles\0004000000138F00\romfs\sound\stream\BGM200.dspadpcm.bcstm` etc.)

That's it. If you did everything right, you should hear [PROSECUTOR PAPYRUS' PURSUIT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex3-nOSNIlc&list=PLXVVSWBfLuf4GPainC6B9uPhLYzOS2I8X) in the game selection menu. To deactivate the mod, just rename the respective folders to anything else! Or deactivate single tracks by changing their names, e. g. to `BGM200.dspadpcm.bcstm_deactivated`.
